A user\u0026rsquo;s encrypted balance is represented as:\nEnc[y](b, r) = (g^b y^r, g^r)\nThis is the key property Tongo leverages on-chain to efficiently update balances while keeping them private.\nTo decipher their balance a user can recover g^b with their private key by computing L / R^x. This is only possible with the knowledge of the private key x. Then g^b has to be brute-forced to obtain b. If b lies in a small range, such as [0, 2^32), the brute force can be done without a problem.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/transfer/","title":"Transfer","section":"Docs","content":" Transfer # When a user y who has a balance b_0, wants to transfer an amount b \u0026lt; b_0 to another user ȳ, they must create two encryptions:\n(L, R) = Enc[y](b, r) (ȴ, ṙ) = Enc[ȳ](b, r)\nThe transaction is done by subtracting the encryption (L, R) from the y balance and adding the encryption (ȴ, ṙ) to the ȳ balance.\nThe sender has to prove that:\nKnowledge of x such that y = g^x (POE) Knowledge of r such that R = g^r (POE) L = g^b y^r (PED) ȴ = g^b ȳ^r (PED) b ∈ [0, b_max) (RAN) The balance after deduction b' = b_0 - b is positive (RAN) "},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/auditor/","title":"Viewing Key / Auditor","section":"Docs","content":" Auditability # Global Auditor # At the time of deploying the Tongo contract, the deploying entity must choose a public key that will serve as the global auditor key. For each user, the contract stores the account balance encrypted under the auditor’s public key.

Decipher the amount sent in any transfer. The global auditor must:\nGenerate a secret key pair (sk, pk) and ensure that the secret key is not leaked. Provide the public key when the contract is deployed. Note: If the global auditor’s secret key is leaked, all balances and transactions could be compromised.
